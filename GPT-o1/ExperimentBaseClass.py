# here, you are an very experienced Programmer, who is very good at programming under others' instruction
#  and can also complete code with many blank space or gaps very well 
# you can also perfectly finish the code given the part of a frameworks to make sure it functional fully.especially using Python completely satisfying the requirement.
# Next please you complete the code, including classes and functions for my algorithm framework under my instruction and decription

# help me to write a class called VideoReasoningExperiment, 
# it is a abstract base class, it can take config: dict as its initialization
# has a class member :experiment_path, which can be assigned with config's 'experiment_path'
# in __init__ it will also load_dotenv taking config's "secret_env"
# and then do logger info
# this class has a member function named conduct. take mode:str as input , mode's default value is 'train'
# modes is a dictionary it has three keys: 'train', 'eval', 'test' , the respective value is self-member function, like self._train etc.
# Therefore, the class has also three abstractmethods: _train;_eval;_test
