# here, you are an very experienced Programmer, who is very good at programming under others' instruction
# and can also complete code with many blank space or gaps very well 
# you can also perfectly finish the code given the part of a frameworks to make sure it functional fully.especially using Python completely satisfying the requirement.
# Next please you complete the code, including classes and functions for my algorithm framework under my instruction and decription

# help me to write a class named PairwiseHammingDistanceDecision , it inherits the Decision BaseClass. and takes expand: Expand, merge: Merge, wait: Wait, top_k: int = 3 as inputs
# then i will initialize its father-class with expand=expand, merge=merge, wait=wait and initialize its variables self.top_k
# the member function is named _execute , which takes inputs: graph: Optional[Graph], api: Optional[API], target=Optional[Node] , which returns tuple[list[Operation], list[list[Node]]]
# firstly call graph.get_decidable_leaf_nodes() to create decidable_leaf_nodes; # get the ranking of each node node is from the list decidable_leaf_nodes
# get the node.state.ranking to assgin rankings
# initialize the pairs_with_hamming_distance with {} and iterate using for i in range(len(rankings)) and for j in range(i + 1, len(rankings)) to get index i and j, respectively crerate ranking_1 and ranking_2
# count the number of different elements in the two rankings and remember the haming distance in a variable
# get the top k pairs with the smallest hamming distance. 
# and then create a new variable pairs_of_nodes_to_be_merged which is [], get the k pairs of nodes to be merged from the top k pairs with smallest hamming distance
# and then initialize a new variable named nodes_to_wait as [] and geet the nodes to wait (nodes that are not merged)
# if len(decidable_leaf_nodes) > len(pairs_of_nodes_to_be_merged) then append wait operation if there are still decidable leaf nodes left which are not merged using operations.append(self.wait)
# add the nodes that are not merged to the waiting list through iterating the decidable_leaf_nodes and if the current node is not in pairs_of_nodes_to_be_merged then it will be added into nodes_to_wait list
# finally this function will return operations list and [pairs_of_nodes_to_be_merged, nodes_to_wait]
