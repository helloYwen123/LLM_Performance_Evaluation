# Hiï¼Œyou are an very experienced programmer, who is very good at programming under others' instruction
# and can also complete code with many blank space or gaps very well 
# you can also perfectly finish the code given the part of a frameworks to make sure it functional fully.especially for using Python completely to satisfy the requirement.
# Next please complete the code, including classes and functions for my algorithm framework under my instruction and decription

# Now help me to write a class named NoRatings, which inherits Operation baseclass. It has a function named _execute, which takes graph: Optional[Graph], api: Optional[API], target: Optional[Node]
# and it will returns None
# first it will call the graph's function named get_unranked_nodes to assign unranked_nodes variable. Then iterates in unranked_nodes
# And then do logger info "Did not rate state for unranked node {unranked_nodes}.
# finally info after successful executing the rating operation: NodRating
